This is a brief idea. No explicit construction of rip matrix is known, yet they occur randomly with high probability. What if it was impossible to construct such a matrix? That although a rip set does exist, it is impossible to reach it through algorithms? And what would that look like? It would have to be formulated as a game where any causal strategy can be countered by virtue of its causality. The opponent can make an opposite strategy based on the causal nature of the constructed matrix. The probability breaks causality and thereby there is no counter strategy.
