We woke up in the parking of a Macdonald. The night was good, even with the bright lights of the parking and the music from the gas station, we slept well. We got up, set up the car and left.

Then we went for a lunch at cypress hills, recommended by PEPE!

So it turns out that the path we took was shut down. We tried to take a small path to have a picnik. Instead we got stuck in the mud. Then I pushed the car, and got full of mud. No Signal on phones, even calling with cellular was not working. I called a towing company, they laughed because of how far we were from them, then the phone cut off.

I went to find some planks to wedge under the wheels. When I returned, Ngan announced that the car was not starting. We also could not remove the key from the key holder.

We got ready to get our things together and walk to the nearest house. Packed valuables in a backpack and were ready to head out. We had to leave the car unlocked because the key was stuck.

That is when a chevrolet semi-truck came driving down the road at low speeds. I waved, and the man greeted us. I explained the obvious fact that we were stuck. He attached a chain and pulled us out. And then the car started again! Truly miraculous. Remarkable. Harry, our saviour, dug us out of a bad situation. We drove back to the safety of the highway.
